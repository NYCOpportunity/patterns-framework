<mark class="badge">Complete</mark> Release [v1 of the Patterns CLI](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/patterns-cli/releases/tag/v1.0.0). v1 culminated a long effort to standardize the way our pattern libraries were created. We went from desperate NPM scripts and configurations to a standard set of packages and tools for building and maintaining patterns for different products and audiences. This development period was a heavy focus on developer tooling and support while also beginning to involve designers in the process of contributing.
