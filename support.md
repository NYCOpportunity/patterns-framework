### Getting Help (how do I do the thing?)

First, check out the documentation for the module you have a question about. They are all GitHub repositories with readme files. If the documentation isn't sufficient create a new issue or reach out to products@nycopportunity.nyc.gov.

### Contributing (how to I add the thing?)

We manage planning and a backlog for all of the modules in the framework using Jira. Reach out to products@nycopportunity.nyc.gov if you are interested in contributing.
